# TASK DESCRIPTION

Generative Text Model Using GPT-2
The primary goal of this project is to develop a text generation model using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically leveraging pre-trained models like GPT-2. The model is designed to generate coherent and contextually relevant paragraphs based on user-provided prompts. This aligns with real-world use cases where automated content creation, summarization, and dialogue systems are in demand.

The model utilizes GPT-2 from Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library, known for its ability to produce human-like language based on context. By taking a short prompt, the model predicts and completes the sentence or paragraph, creating multiple variations depending on parameters like temperature, max_length, and number of outputs. The tool can be deployed in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, offering interactive controls for non-programmers as well.

This task involves several key steps:

Installing and importing NLP libraries.

Loading the pre-trained GPT-2 model.

Accepting dynamic inputs from the user (prompt, length, creativity).

Generating and displaying multiple coherent outputs.

(Optional) Saving results or deploying via a user interface.

This notebook-style solution is scalable and easy to enhance with model switching (e.g., GPT-2 â†’ GPT-3), result export options, or UI elements using ipywidgets.
